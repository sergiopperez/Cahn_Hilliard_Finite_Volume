# Cahn_Hilliard_Finite_Volume
Finite-volume schemes for the Cahn-Hilliard equation that unconditionally and discretely satisfy the boundedness of the phase field and the free-energy dissipation. Our scheme is applicable to a variety of free-energy potentials including the Ginzburg-Landau and Flory-Huggins, general wetting boundary conditions accounting for wall free energies, and degenerate mobilities.
